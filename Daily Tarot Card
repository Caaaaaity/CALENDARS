SUMMARY:Tarot: IX The Hermit
DESCRIPTION:Card: IX The Hermit

Upright:
For you, The Hermit is not about hiding; it is about taking your energy back from anything and anyone that keeps wasting it. This is you closing the door, shutting down the noise, and letting your own mind be the authority again. Upright, The Hermit says the answers you are looking for about money, work, creative direction, and your next move are already in your head – they are just buried under frustration and external bullshit. Today is a day for deep thinking, self-audit, planning, and designing your next era without asking for outside permission.

Reversed:
Reversed, The Hermit shows up when “I need space” becomes “I don’t trust anyone, so I’ll suffer alone.” You may be isolating not because it feels healing, but because you are tired of being disappointed or misunderstood. It can look like ghosting your own ideas, numbing out, scrolling, or staying frozen instead of using your solitude to actually move yourself forward. The card reversed warns you that you are closing the door on support as well as on noise.

Daily Advice:
Take one hour today that belongs to you and only you. Use it to review your current goals versus what you actually want now: your income targets, your art projects, your environment, your schedule. Ask yourself, “If I truly trusted myself, what would I stop doing? What would I double down on?” Write the answers down. You are allowed to restructure your life based on your own insight, not what anyone else expects.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Queen of Wands
DESCRIPTION:Card: Queen of Wands

Upright:
Queen of Wands is your inner showrunner – the version of you that knows she is magnetic, creative, and unforgettable, and actually uses it. Upright, this card says your charisma is a tool, not an accident. Your eye for color, texture, aesthetics, and drama is part of how you are meant to make money and impact people. Today favors putting yourself and your work in front of others: publishing something, sharing your ideas, dressing like your future self, or taking the kind of bold, visible action that past you would have hesitated over.

Reversed:
Reversed, Queen of Wands shows up when your fire gets twisted. Either you dim way down and pretend you’re “not that special” so no one can judge you, or you burn hot from defensiveness and anger because people and systems keep wasting your time. It can show as snapping at everything, or shrinking from everything. This card reversed says your confidence has been hit, and part of you is questioning whether you’re “too much,” “too loud,” or “too difficult,” when really you’re surrounded by people/tools that can’t handle your voltage.

Daily Advice:
Do one unapologetically bold thing today that expresses who you actually are. That might be posting art that feels too much, starting a project that feels “too big,” or saying no to something that requires you to play small. You don’t need everyone to approve of you – you need the right people to recognize you. The more you stand in your full Queen of Wands energy, the faster those people and opportunities can find you.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Five of Pentacles
DESCRIPTION:Card: Five of Pentacles

Upright:
Five of Pentacles is the card of feeling shut out, under-resourced, or left to fend for yourself. Upright for you, this is that “I’m so tired of scrambling” energy – the stress of finances, tech failures, and lack of real support that makes you feel like you’re always clawing your way up from behind. It’s honest about the struggle but also honest about your resilience: you’ve learned to create from nothing, to decorate pressure, to keep going without a safety net.

Reversed:
Reversed, Five of Pentacles often marks the turning point where you stop accepting scarcity as your identity. It can show when you’re ready to change your relationship to money, opportunities, and support – but old fear still whispers that nothing will change. It may also reveal where you’re accidentally keeping yourself outside the “warm building” by not applying, not posting, not asking, not trying because you’ve decided the answer must be no.

Daily Advice:
Do one concrete thing today that moves you out of scarcity mode. That might be listing a product, planning a low-effort digital offer, reviewing subscriptions to cut what drains you, or writing out a realistic money plan for the next three months. This card is not saying “you’re doomed”; it’s saying “you are walking past doors that are meant to open for you.” Choose one door and knock.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Two of Cups
DESCRIPTION:Card: Two of Cups

Upright:
Two of Cups is true energetic reciprocity – mutual respect, attraction, or collaboration. Upright for you, this card is not just romance; it is also creative and business partnership energy where both sides actually show up. It signals the possibility of feeling seen instead of used, supported instead of drained. This can be a day where a real ally steps forward, or where you recognize who in your life actually meets you halfway instead of expecting you to carry everything.

Reversed:
Reversed, Two of Cups highlights imbalance, disappointment, or connections that look good on paper but feel wrong in reality. It can show arguments, misunderstandings, or the dawning realization that you are more invested than the other party – or vice versa. It may also reflect a pattern: settling for half-hearted energy because you’re used to doing most of the emotional or creative labor.

Daily Advice:
Scan your relationships and collaborations and be brutally honest: who genuinely pours into you, and who only takes? Today, invest more time and energy into the connections that feel mutual – people who listen, support, share, or at least respect your boundaries. You are allowed to emotionally divest from anything that leaves you feeling smaller, confused, or constantly drained. Make one small shift in who gets your energy.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Ace of Wands
DESCRIPTION:Card: Ace of Wands

Upright:
Ace of Wands is raw creative spark – the “I have to make this” feeling. Upright, this card for you is that surge of energy when a new idea drops in: a product line, a mixed-media piece, a course, a brand pivot, a blog, a zine, a glam workbook. It’s primal fire, not fully shaped yet, but powerful. Today favors catching inspiration before it evaporates – sketching, outlining, brainstorming, moodboarding. You don’t have to know all the steps yet; you just have to say yes to the spark.

Reversed:
Reversed, Ace of Wands can show creative frustration, false starts, or the feeling of being lit up inside but blocked in execution. You might be doubting every idea before it even lands, telling yourself it’s not original enough, not profitable enough, or not worth the effort. It can also show pure exhaustion: the fire is there, but you’re too drained by everything else to pick up the torch.

Daily Advice:
When an idea hits you today, do NOT immediately ask, “But how?” Instead, write it down in full detail. Give the idea a page, a note, a board of its own. You can figure out logistics later – right now your job is to honor the download. Pick one idea and take a tiny, visible step: a filename, a product name, a rough cover, a first page. Treat your ideas like they are worth protecting, not interrogating to death.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Seven of Cups
DESCRIPTION:Card: Seven of Cups

Upright:
Seven of Cups is the card of options, fantasies, and possibilities. For you, upright, this is that space where your mind explodes with aesthetics, products, projects, courses, room makeovers, outfits, branding directions – all glittering at once. It’s powerful because it proves you are not short on inspiration. The challenge is focus: not every cup deserves to be turned into a full project. This card says you are in a dreaming phase, and your job is to choose what feels aligned, not chase everything that sparkles.

Reversed:
Reversed, Seven of Cups shows confusion, overwhelm, or disillusionment. You may feel foggy, unable to choose, or like every option has a catch. It can also reflect escapism – losing yourself in fantasy, scrolling, daydreaming, or planning “one day” projects so you never have to risk bringing one real thing into the world. The card warns that staying in endless options can be a subtle form of self-sabotage.

Daily Advice:
Pick one cup. Write down all the ideas swirling in your head, then circle the one that feels both exciting and doable within the next 30 days. Commit to that. You can keep a “later” list, but today you move that one idea closer to reality: name it, define it, and decide its first step. You don’t need to kill your other ideas – just give one of them a chance to become real.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Ten of Wands
DESCRIPTION:Card: Ten of Wands

Upright:
Ten of Wands upright is carrying a lot – sometimes too much. For you, this is the card of doing everything yourself: managing the ideas, the tech, the planning, the emotional labor, the cleaning, the healing, all at once. It acknowledges your capacity and your grind, but it also points out the weight. You are strong, but you are not meant to haul every single thing alone forever. Upright, this card says you’re closer to the destination than you think, but you need to adjust how you’re carrying the load.

Reversed:
Reversed, Ten of Wands is burnout, resentment, or refusing to set down burdens that are no longer yours. You might be dragging old obligations, outdated self-expectations, or other people’s problems along with you. It can also show up as feeling like everything is heavy even when tasks are small, because your nervous system is overloaded. The card reversed asks: which of these wands actually belong to you, and which are you carrying out of habit, guilt, or fear?

Daily Advice:
List what you’re carrying today: tasks, people, promises, projects. Then cross out one thing that you do not actually have to carry anymore. Delegate it, delay it, or drop it. Your empire does not get built faster by breaking yourself in the process. Re-choose your load so that the weight you carry is made of things that matter to the future you want.

SUMMARY:Tarot: II The High Priestess
DESCRIPTION:Card: II The High Priestess

Upright:
The High Priestess is your raw intuition, your psychic edge, your ability to feel the truth underneath what people say. Upright, this card says that today, your gut is more accurate than any external advice. You are naturally tuned into symbolism, aesthetic clues, and energetic vibes – use that. This card favors quiet observation, inner listening, and choosing based on what feels deeply right even if you can’t explain why to anyone else.

Reversed:
Reversed, The High Priestess can show self-doubt around your own intuition. You may feel disconnected from your inner voice, or you might be gaslighting yourself – telling yourself you’re “overreacting” when your body is literally screaming no. It can also point to ignoring red flags because you’re tired of starting over, or because you want something to work so badly that you’re willing to override your instincts.

Daily Advice:
Pause before you commit to anything today – social plans, purchases, projects, conversations. Check in with your body and emotional reaction first. If something feels heavy, tight, or draining in your chest or stomach, treat that as real data. If something feels open, curious, or quietly exciting, treat that as real data too. Act as if your intuition is a skill you’re refining, not a flaw you need to shut up.

SUMMARY:Tarot: III The Empress
DESCRIPTION:Card: III The Empress

Upright:
The Empress is luxury, creativity, and self-worth embodied. Upright for you, this is the card of treating yourself like the muse, not the servant. It’s about beauty as nourishment – textiles, color, decor, clothes, food, rituals that make your body and space feel held. It also signals fertile creative energy: ideas can grow more easily now if you give them a supportive environment. This isn’t hustle energy; it’s “I am worthy of comfort while I build” energy.

Reversed:
Reversed, The Empress can show neglecting your own needs, or tying your worth only to productivity and output. You might be running yourself down, living in a space that doesn’t feel like you, or postponing pleasure and rest until some imaginary future milestone. It can also reflect creative block that comes from feeling emotionally under-nourished and physically overstressed.

Daily Advice:
Do one thing today that treats you as someone valuable right now, not “once you succeed.” That might be beautifying a small area of your room, wearing something that makes you feel hot even if no one sees it, or cooking yourself a nice meal instead of scavenging. At the same time, pick one idea or project and give it a little Empress-level care: a nicer mockup, a more intentional aesthetic, a refined presentation. You and your work both deserve to feel cherished.

SUMMARY:Tarot: X Wheel of Fortune
DESCRIPTION:Card: X Wheel of Fortune

Upright:
Wheel of Fortune is cycles, timing, and turning points. Upright for you, this card says the energy around you is shifting – not because you forced it, but because a cycle is naturally rolling over. It can bring synchronicities, sudden opportunities, or random-seeming events that later make sense. It’s a reminder that you are not doomed to repeat the same loop forever, even if it has felt like that recently.

Reversed:
Reversed, Wheel of Fortune can feel like bad luck, delays, or being stuck in a loop you’re sick of. It might seem like every time you try to move forward, something glitches. But this card reversed often highlights where you keep making the same choices out of habit, fear, or impatience. It’s less “the universe hates you” and more “you deserve a different pattern than the one you’re repeating.”

Daily Advice:
Notice what is repeating in your life right now – not just what’s happening, but what you keep choosing. Identify one pattern you’re over (how you react, who you text, what you say yes to) and deliberately make a different choice today. At the same time, stay open to odd little bits of luck: a conversation, a link, a thought that feels like a nudge. The wheel is easier to turn when you stop putting your own foot on the brake.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Knight of Swords
DESCRIPTION:Card: Knight of Swords

Upright:
Knight of Swords is fast, sharp, decisive energy. Upright for you, this is your “I’m done, I’m fixing this now” mode – direct, strategic, and mentally clear. It’s amazing for cutting through confusion, writing, messaging, planning, or making firm decisions. Today favors actions that require courage and clarity more than softness: sending the email, stating your terms, outlining the project, setting the rule.

Reversed:
Reversed, Knight of Swords becomes impulsive or reckless – reacting from anger, frustration, or ego instead of aligned strategy. It can show as arguing just to win, saying things you can’t unsay, or burning bridges that you might actually need later. It also warns against talking about your plans more than you are actually building them.

Daily Advice:
Use your sharpness with intention. Choose one area where you need a clean decision – a boundary, a schedule choice, a yes/no, a commitment – and make it. At the same time, if you feel yourself about to lash out or go off, pause long enough to ask, “Will this move me closer to the life I want, or just discharge my anger?” Aim your sword at problems, not at yourself.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Page of Cups
DESCRIPTION:Card: Page of Cups

Upright:
Page of Cups is sweet, imaginative, beginner-heart energy. Upright, this card for you is the part of you that still believes in magic, art for art’s sake, and little emotional risks. It’s softer than your usual warrior mode – more like the kid version of you who loved making things without worrying if they would sell. Today favors small experiments: a new style, a playful sketch, a silly idea, or a vulnerable conversation.

Reversed:
Reversed, Page of Cups can show emotional immaturity, hypersensitivity, or shutting down your softer side because it feels unsafe. You might be rejecting your own feelings as “dramatic,” or refusing to let yourself try something new because you’re scared of looking foolish. It can also show a tendency to escape into fantasy or crush-energy instead of building your real life.

Daily Advice:
Let yourself do one thing today that is purely for curiosity or joy, not performance. That might be trying a new medium, playing with color for no reason, writing a dreamy note to future you, or listening to music and doodling. You don’t have to monetize every part of yourself. The more you give your Page of Cups some room, the more fuel your bigger creative and business moves will have.

SUMMARY:Tarot: XI Justice
DESCRIPTION:Card: XI Justice

Upright:
Justice upright is cause-and-effect, fairness, and consequences. For you, this is the card of receipts – things balancing out based on what has really been happening, not what people say. It can bring clarity around legal, financial, or contract matters, but it also applies to your personal patterns: where you’ve been honest with yourself versus where you’ve lied to keep the peace. Today has “no more pretending” energy.

Reversed:
Reversed, Justice shows imbalance, avoidance of responsibility, or situations where the truth is being distorted. Someone (possibly you, possibly others) may be dodging accountability, telling half-truths, or rewriting history. It can also reflect self-blame where you take on guilt for things that were never in your control.

Daily Advice:
Look at one situation where you feel wronged, and one where you might be avoiding your own responsibility. Be honest with yourself about both. If you need to stand up for yourself – with a company, a person, a system – start gathering evidence and planning your move. If you need to correct your own behavior, do it in a way that supports your future instead of punishing your past. Aim for alignment, not perfection.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Nine of Cups
DESCRIPTION:Card: Nine of Cups

Upright:
Nine of Cups is satisfaction, emotional wish fulfillment, and enjoying what you’ve created. Upright for you, this card is permission to actually feel good about your tastes, your skills, and the life you are building – even if it’s not “finished” yet. It’s the vibe of sitting back for a minute and recognizing how far you’ve come from past versions of yourself. Pleasure, indulgence, and genuine pride are not distractions; they refill you.

Reversed:
Reversed, Nine of Cups can show chasing surface-level gratification while ignoring deeper needs, or never letting yourself feel proud because you’re always moving the goalpost. You might be numbing with small treats instead of addressing big changes, or downplaying every win because it’s “not big enough yet.”

Daily Advice:
Acknowledge one thing you’ve done or survived this year that past you would be impressed by. Let yourself feel that. Then, treat yourself in a deliberate way – a small luxury, a cozy ritual, a break, something that says, “I see the work I’ve done.” You are allowed to enjoy moments of contentment without waiting for your life to be perfectly organized or perfectly successful first.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Six of Wands
DESCRIPTION:Card: Six of Wands

Upright:
Six of Wands is recognition, validation, and visible progress. Upright for you, this card says something you do, say, or create now actually lands. People notice. You might finally see evidence that your skills and taste are not just “in your head.” This is a win energy, even if it is a small one—a compliment, a sale, a breakthrough, a moment where you feel genuinely proud.

Reversed:
Reversed, Six of Wands can show feeling unseen or unappreciated. You may be doing a lot and getting very little feedback, or comparing your progress to others and deciding you’re “behind.” It can also reflect fear of success—part of you wants to be known, and another part is scared of the pressure that comes with it.

Daily Advice:
Acknowledge one win today, even if no one else claps for it. Document it—screenshot, journal, notes app. Then do one thing that makes your work a little more visible: share, show, submit, or present something. You are allowed to let people see that you’re good at what you do.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Four of Swords
DESCRIPTION:Card: Four of Swords

Upright:
Four of Swords is intentional rest, mental recovery, and putting your brain on a charger. Upright for you, this card says your nervous system needs a reset so your creativity and decisions can sharpen again. This isn’t laziness; it’s maintenance. Today is ideal for quiet, naps, low-stimulation time, and stepping back from chaos.

Reversed:
Reversed, Four of Swords shows rest-debt and burnout denial. You may be exhausted but still forcing productivity, or “resting” in ways that aren’t actually restful (doom scroll, rage-watch, spiral). It can also mean your mind won’t stop replaying shit, even when your body is still.

Daily Advice:
Give yourself a real pause. Even 30 minutes with your phone away, eyes off screens, and body actually relaxing will help. Try lying down, stretching, or just staring out the window. You don’t earn rest by suffering enough—you need it to function like the creative strategist you are.

SUMMARY:Tarot: XIII Death
DESCRIPTION:Card: XIII Death

Upright:
Death upright is deep transformation: an era ending so a truer one can begin. For you, this is not physical death; it is the death of a way of doing things that you’ve outgrown. Old identities, aesthetics, dynamics, or survival strategies are ready to be shed. It can feel bittersweet or scary, but it clears stuck energy.

Reversed:
Reversed, Death shows resistance to change. You know something is over—a style, a pattern, a relationship, a workflow—but you keep reviving it instead of letting it go. This keeps you trapped in a version of yourself that no longer fits, which is why everything feels tight and irritating.

Daily Advice:
Name one thing you are done with. Not “eventually”—now. Decide how you will end, release, or stop feeding it. That might be an app, a project, a self-talk loop, or a role you keep playing. Make space so something actually aligned has room to grow.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Three of Pentacles
DESCRIPTION:Card: Three of Pentacles

Upright:
Three of Pentacles is collaboration, skill, and building something structured. Upright for you, this card says your work improves when you treat it like a real project, not random chaos. It also hints that the right collaborators or resources could amplify what you do, especially in business and design.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can mean disorganized teamwork, feeling undervalued, or trying to do everything solo because past people have been incompetent. It may also show you low-key resisting structure, even though you know structure would help.

Daily Advice:
Pick one project and give it a real framework: sections, deadlines, steps, or a simple system. If there’s someone whose skills complement yours (tech, admin, marketing), imagine what delegating one tiny piece would look like—even if you’re not ready yet. Organize your genius so it can actually support you.

SUMMARY:Tarot: VIII Strength
DESCRIPTION:Card: VIII Strength

Upright:
Strength upright is calm power, not forced aggression. For you, this card is your ability to stay centered and self-possessed even when everything around you is dumb or chaotic. It’s self-control that comes from self-respect. It says you are stronger than your impulses and your fear, and you don’t have to scream to be powerful.

Reversed:
Reversed, Strength can show losing patience, snapping, or feeling like you’re too tired to regulate anything. You might feel out of control with reactions, or like you’re constantly fighting yourself—either bulldozing your feelings or drowning in them.

Daily Advice:
Treat yourself like someone you’re responsible for protecting. If you feel a blow-up coming, step away, breathe, and choose a response that protects your long-term goals, not just your mood in the moment. Use your fire strategically, not randomly.

Upright:
Four of Wands is celebration, home, and small milestones. Upright for you, this card says there is something in your environment or your work that deserves to be marked and enjoyed—a finished corner, a completed task, a new habit, a subtle upgrade in your life. It’s about stabilization and joy.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can indicate feeling like you don’t belong anywhere, or struggling to feel “at home” in your life or space. You might feel like your wins are invisible or that there’s always something wrong so you can’t relax.

Daily Advice:
Do one thing to make your environment feel more like your version of home—rearrange decor, add something pretty, clear one patch of clutter. Then consciously acknowledge at least one thing you’ve built or survived this year. You’re allowed to feel good about it.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Seven of Swords
DESCRIPTION:Card: Seven of Swords

Upright:
Seven of Swords is strategy, secrecy, and moving smart. Upright, this card says you don’t have to announce everything you’re building. Sometimes the most powerful move is to quietly work behind the scenes until you’re ready to reveal. It’s about being clever, protective of your ideas, and selective about what you share.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can indicate self-deception, sneaky behavior, or guilt—either you’re not being honest with yourself, or someone around you is not being fully straight. It can also reflect imposter syndrome: feeling like you’re “faking it,” even when you’re not.

Daily Advice:
Keep at least one thing private today: a plan, a project, a move. Let it grow without commentary. At the same time, check yourself for where you might be lying to yourself about what you want or what you’re willing to do. Clean up your own integrity so your strategy is sharp and clean.

SUMMARY:Tarot: XIX The Sun
DESCRIPTION:Card: XIX The Sun

Upright:
The Sun is joy, clarity, and warmth. Upright for you, this card is your permission slip to enjoy your own energy, your own taste, and your own life without apologizing. It brings optimism and straightforward truth. Things that were confusing may feel more obvious now. This is “light on your face, main character, I actually deserve happiness” energy.

Reversed:
Reversed, The Sun can show blocked joy—feeling like you’re not allowed to be happy until everything is fixed, or minimizing your own light so you don’t make others uncomfortable. It can also be low mood or burnout overshadowing good things.

Daily Advice:
Lean into what feels good today without guilt: music, food, clothes, decorating, content, people. Let yourself have a moment of uncomplicated enjoyment. Also ask: if I stopped pretending I didn’t know what I want, what would I admit? Let the answer surface.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Five of Wands
DESCRIPTION:Card: Five of Wands

Upright:
Five of Wands is conflict, tension, or competition. Upright, this card can show external drama, clashing opinions, or inner static. For you, it might be arguing with systems, people, or yourself. Sometimes it’s creative friction—multiple ideas all fighting for attention.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can indicate suppressed anger, avoiding necessary conflict, or constant inner arguments that never go anywhere. You might be exhausted by drama and just want peace, but still end up in chaotic situations.

Daily Advice:
Pick your battles. You don’t have to fight every stupid thing. Decide what is truly worth your energy and let the rest slide. If the fight is inside your own head, write it out so you can see what’s actually going on and pick a direction.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Two of Swords
DESCRIPTION:Card: Two of Swords

Upright:
Two of Swords is stalemate, indecision, and blocking things out. Upright for you, this card says you might be sitting between two options and refusing to pick because neither feels perfect. You may also be avoiding feeling something because you’re tired of your own emotions.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show mental overload, anxiety, and decision fatigue. You might be trying to hold contradictory truths at once, or ignoring your intuition so long that you feel numb and stuck. It’s the “I don’t know and I don’t want to think about it anymore” vibe.

Daily Advice:
Make one small decision today that moves something forward, even if it’s not The Big Decision. Choose a direction for one project, one habit, or one plan. You can adjust later. Stagnation drains you more than imperfect motion.

SUMMARY:Tarot: King of Pentacles
DESCRIPTION:Card: King of Pentacles

Upright:
King of Pentacles is wealth, stability, and long-term building. Upright for you, this card is your CEO version—the part of you that actually knows how you want money to feel: steady, luxurious, supportive of your creativity. It’s about taking your business and financial life seriously, not in a boring way, but in a “I am the owner of this empire” way.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show money stress, undercharging, or treating yourself like the least important asset in your own world. It might also reflect fear of responsibility—wanting success but being wary of the structure and commitment required.

Daily Advice:
Do one grounded money action today: review pricing, outline an offer, map out income streams, or check your accounts without spiraling. Ask, “What would the version of me running a real, successful brand do with money today?” Then copy her.

DESCRIPTION:Card: Page of Swords

Upright:
Page of Swords is curiosity, learning, and ideas in motion. Upright for you, this card says your mind is sharp and restless. It’s great for research, note-taking, brainstorming, or learning something that helps your creative or business life. You’re picking up on patterns and information quickly.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show overthinking, gossip, or scattered mental energy. You might be jumping from thought to thought, or talking about what you want to do more than actually doing it. It can also reflect anxiety and intrusive thoughts.

Daily Advice:
Channel your curiosity into something useful: watch one tutorial that actually helps your skills, write out a content plan, or study something about marketing, design, or tarot that excites you. Avoid getting sucked into drama or pointless debates.

SUMMARY:Tarot: XIV Temperance
DESCRIPTION:Card: XIV Temperance

Upright:
Temperance is balance, blending, and moderation. Upright for you, this card is about finding your middle ground between extremes: all-or-nothing, burnout-or-collapse, overworking-or-doing-nothing. It says you can mix your different worlds—mystical and practical, glam and grounded, work and rest—into something sustainable.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show imbalance, excess, or refusing to adjust. You may swing hard between obsessive focus and total shutdown, or expect one area of life to fix all the others. It can also mean ignoring your body’s signals.

Daily Advice:
Notice one area where you’ve been extreme lately (sleep, screens, spending, work, isolation). Make a small adjustment toward the middle today. Think “tweak,” not overhaul. You’re building a rhythm you can actually maintain.

SUMMARY:Tarot: XX Judgement
DESCRIPTION:Card: XX Judgement

Upright:
Judgement is awakening, reckoning, and choosing a new level. Upright for you, this card is that moment of “I can’t unsee this about myself or my life.” It’s a big-picture review: what has this year really been about, and who are you becoming? It calls you to answer your own calling louder, and stop living like you don’t know what that is.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show self-judgment, doubt, or ignoring your own inner call. You might be stuck in “who am I to?” thoughts, or recycling old stories instead of stepping into the bigger version of you that you actually are ready for.

Daily Advice:
Reflect on this year without sugarcoating, but also without cruelty. What did you outgrow? What did you prove to yourself? What wants to come with you into the next year, and what doesn’t? Make one decision or declaration tonight that aligns with the life you actually want, not the life you’ve been settling for.

SUMMARY:Tarot: I The Magician
DESCRIPTION:Card: I The Magician

Upright:
The Magician is manifestation, focus, and using your tools. Upright for you, this card says you already have enough skills, experience, and resources to start making something real. It’s not about waiting for the “perfect” conditions; it’s about directing what you do have with intention. Your words, visuals, ideas, and effort are all magic ingredients.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show scattered intention, wasted potential, or feeling like a fraud. You might be dabbling in many directions instead of committing, or talking yourself out of using your gifts because you’re afraid of being seen.

Daily Advice:
Pick one main intention for this year in plain language: money, creative output, lifestyle, business. Write it down somewhere you’ll see it. Then choose one specific action today that lines up with that spell—something small but real. You’re not just wishing; you’re directing your energy like the magician you are.

SUMMARY:Tarot: Three of Wands
DESCRIPTION:Card: Three of Wands

Upright:
Three of Wands is expansion, planning, and waiting for results. Upright for you, this card says your vision is bigger than your current room, and that’s good. You’re looking out at what’s possible beyond immediate circumstances. It favors long-range planning: product lines, launches, travel, relocation, big creative arcs.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show delayed results, impatience, or fear of going beyond your comfort zone. You might be sabotaging your own expansion by staying in environments, relationships, or routines that don’t match where you want to go.

Daily Advice:
Map out one bigger thing you want within the next 12 months. Then, break it into 3–5 major steps. Today, take the first micro-step. Keep your eyes on the horizon instead of obsessing over tiny detours.

Upright:
Four of Cups is emotional boredom, dissatisfaction, or needing something deeper. Upright for you, this card says the usual distractions and surface-level things aren’t hitting anymore. You may feel over it, checked out, or unimpressed by what’s available.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can indicate emerging from emotional apathy or finally noticing an opportunity you previously ignored. It can also show you rejecting help, ideas, or chances because they don’t look perfect at first glance.

Daily Advice:
Check in with yourself: what are you actually craving – emotionally, creatively, spiritually? Instead of numbing out, name it. Then look around for one small way to give yourself a taste of that today. Don’t dismiss something just because it’s not your ultimate fantasy version.

Upright:
The Chariot is movement, willpower, and directed drive. Upright, this is your “get the fuck out of my way, I have shit to do” energy, but harnessed. It’s about aligning your emotions and mind toward one trajectory so you stop internally fighting yourself.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show feeling out of control, stuck in place, or pulled in opposite directions. You might be trying to go everywhere at once, or wasting energy fighting things you can’t change instead of steering what you can.

Daily Advice:
Choose one lane today and commit to it. For example: “Today is a design day,” “Today is a money admin day,” or “Today is a deep clean day.” Align your actions with that lane and let yourself feel how it is to move in one direction on purpose.

Upright:
Eight of Pentacles is craft, skill-building, and focused work. Upright for you, this card says your mastery grows every time you sit down and actually do the thing—sew, paint, design, write, film, edit, list. It’s the repetition that makes you dangerous in your lane.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show boredom, sloppiness, or half-committing. You might be jumping from idea to idea without refining any of them, or settling for “good enough” when you know you could create something incredible with a bit more intention.

Daily Advice:
Pick one skill or project and give it a focused work block today—no multitasking. Refine a detail, improve the packaging, clean the files, practice a technique. This is how your empire becomes undeniable: tiny increments of mastery.

The Moon is intuition, illusion, and deep subconscious tides. Upright for you, this card amplifies your psychic sensitivity, dreams, and feelings. Things may feel surreal, symbolic, or emotionally heightened. It’s a good day to create from your inner world.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show anxiety, confusion, or misreading signals. You may be projecting fears onto situations or doubting your own perceptions so much that you can’t tell what’s real.

Daily Advice:
Don’t force logical answers today. Instead, let your inner world speak through imagery, music, writing, or design. If you’re anxious, ask: what is this feeling trying to warn or tell me? Distinguish real intuition from spiraling by checking: does this insight feel grounded or hysterical?

Upright:
Ten of Swords is a hard ending, a “that’s it, it’s done” moment. Upright, this card for you is the point where something cannot keep going the way it has been. It’s not subtle. It may feel dramatic, but it’s also a line in the sand.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show slowly recovering from rock bottom, or refusing to admit something is over. You might be clinging to the last shreds of a situation that has nothing left to give.

Daily Advice:
Let one dead thing be dead. Stop talking to it, feeding it, or giving it your mental energy. Even just deciding “I’m done obsessing about this” is powerful. From that ground, you can actually start fresh.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show impulsive risk, ego, or avoidance of responsibility. You might want the glory without the planning, or feel threatened when things don’t go your way.

Act like the creative director of your own life today. Make one decisive move that aligns with the version of you who leads—choose a project to prioritize, a vibe to build, or a standard you won’t drop below.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show being stuck in the past, idealizing old times, or letting old wounds quietly dictate current choices.

Daily Advice:
Do one thing that your kid self would have loved: a silly drawing, a bright outfit, a comfort movie, a playful project. At the same time, note one old story you’re done letting control you. You can honor the past without living in it.

Reversed:
Reversed, it can show financial anxiety, feeling like you’re pretending, or not letting yourself enjoy anything you have because you’re fixated on what’s missing.

Daily Advice:
Do one thing that makes your current life feel more like your upgraded life: organize a little vanity area, print something pretty, upgrade one item, or plan a daily ritual. You’re training your system to recognize abundance as normal, not rare.

Reversed:
Reversed, it often signals readiness to slowly look up from the spilled cups and see what’s left and what’s possible. It doesn’t erase hurt, but it shows healing beginning.

Daily Advice:
Let yourself be honest about one loss that still stings. Then, deliberately notice one resource, relationship, or capacity you still have. You’re allowed to grieve and still move toward what remains.

Transition, moving away from rough waters toward calmer ones. It’s not instant fix energy; it’s “we’re leaving the worst of it behind.”

Reversed:
Stuck in limbo, mentally revisiting old pain, or half-leaving situations but not fully committing to the move.

Daily Advice:
Choose one mental or physical shift that symbolizes leaving an old phase: clear a folder, change a routine, unfollow something, or physically rearrange a space to match the new chapter.

Upright:
Defending your ground, holding your position. You’ve worked for what you have; this is about not letting other people’s bullshit knock you off your stance.

Reversed:
Feeling attacked, defensive for no reason, or burning out from having to fight constantly.

Daily Advice:
Clarify what hill is actually worth defending. Stand firm in one boundary or standard today, and consciously ignore challenges that are just noise.

Reversed:
Healing, release, or picking at an old wound instead of letting it close.

Daily Advice:
Name one thing that still hurts and one lesson you’re taking from it. You don’t have to forgive or forget today—but you can stop letting it define your next moves.

Staying too long where you’re not fulfilled, or emotionally checking out without physically moving on anything.

Slow shift from “everything is ruined” to “not everything is ruined.” Space opens for hope or new plans.
